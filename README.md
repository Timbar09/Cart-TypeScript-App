# Shopping Cart Project

## Overview

This project is a simple shopping cart web application, built as part of a [TypeScript tutorial](https://youtu.be/gieEQFIfgYc) by Dave Gray. The app demonstrates essential functionality for managing products in a shopping cart, including adding, removing, and updating items, while dynamically rendering the cart interface.

## Features

- **View Products**: The main section shows a list of available products when you open the application.
- **Add to Cart**: Each product has a button to add it to the shopping cart.
- **View Cart**: Clicking the "View Cart" button in the header switches the view to display the cart, which shows all items added.
- **Cart Management**:
  - Adjust the quantity of each item in the cart.
  - See unit prices, total costs for each product, and the overall cart total.
  - Remove items from the cart as needed.
- **Place Order**: A "Place Order" button finalizes the current cart, simulating an order placement.

## Future Enhancements

Future additions could include features similar to those implemented in previous projects, such as:

- Improved product display design.
- Product categories and filters.
- Product pages with detailed information.
- Payment gateway integration.
- User authentication and account management.
- Order history and tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast dev server with hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **SCSS**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

## Running Locally

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Timbar09/Cart-TypeScript-App.git
cd Cart-TypeScript-App
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Learning Experience

This project was primarily an exercise in TypeScript and React, focusing on state management and component interaction. It provided a good opportunity to practice TypeScript syntax and concepts, such as interfaces, types, and generics, as well as React hooks and props.
